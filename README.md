## Instructions to make ScidvsPC Compatible Piece Sets from SVG Images
Use the script entitled "MkScidPieces_fromSVG" in the repository. </br>

./MkScidPieces_fromSVG [DirectoryName] </br>
If your pieces are in a Directory named Alpha (i.e. the name of the piece type): </br>
./MkScidPieces_fromSVG Alpha </br>

Save the output into a text file, and save this into usr/{name of User}/.scidvspc/pieces (note that you need to create the pieces directory).
